=== BOAT GAME ===
about fishing but with a horro esque twist
trying to catch biggest fish 
but constantly seeing another fisherman haunting them
uses fishing mechanic, must fish up different parts of something?
saves progress

= fishing mechanic =
shouldn't mess up camera overly or anything but should direct it
i don't think i want rod up all the time, should only come out when player wants to fish
distinct player states ? fishing & not fishing
    move the boat while not, stationary and rod up when fishing
    when fishing mode can freely walk around teh boat and look at different things

maybe:
 - hold left click to put rod back, let go to cast
 - holding charges meter, holding too long makes it slowly go back down
 - cast goes in dir of mouse cursor, lands
 - stays in this state until something bites
 - when bites, bobber dips below surface, player must hold click to reel
 - just holding makes it go too fast, must reel in then pause, reel pause, etc
 - maybe meter goes up slowly that shows integrity
 - if it reaches top bar it cuts off
