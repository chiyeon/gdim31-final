=== fishing / navigating mechanic ===
player is always in one of two states: NAVIGATING or FISHING

when NAVIGATING:
the player is at the helm of the ship (the rear) and can control the speed they move forward (W/S to increase or decrease, it stays the same)
and the turning direction (A/D).

They also have access to a compass

(undecided)
if they get out of this mode, the boat will continue in the specified speed and direction

when FISHING
the player can move freely around the boat with WASD

as they hold left click, they begin winding up a fishing rod swing with power/range that increases the longer they hold to a cap

once they cast, they cannot turn away or else the line will break. They can right click to cut the line or left click to pull it

if something catches, the bobber will dip below the water. if something is on the hook, a shadow will be below water.
if pulling too fast / frequently, whatever has bitten will fall off, so care and control must be afforded

if a player sees special objects (crates) they can hook and pull them with no penalty.
