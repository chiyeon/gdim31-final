=== note 1 ===
found in crate right as player starts the game, alongside a map

goal:   introduce the idea of finding parts to build a way outlined 
        they were also trapped there, unknown if they escaped
        hint at first location
part:   handle

=== note 2 ===
found after catching first part

goal:   talk about entity chasing them, unknown what it is but warn against getting caught
        hint at next location
part:   reel

=== note 3 ===
found after catching second part

goal:   talk about large entity swimming below, possibly not hostile intentions
        hint at next location
part:   rod

=== note 4 ===
found after catching third part

goal:   found location of entity swimming below, the only hope at getting out
        hint at location of entity, but say it never ever arrived, wouldnt bite
part:   nothing, but knows location of entity
note:   at this point, the player should clearly see the areas where they should fish on the map
        and there should be a space it looks naturally like there should be fishing done there even
        if there isnt a marker, making them curious and want to go there

=== note 5 ===
hidden find somewhere near the final component area

goal:   talk about needing something specific to lure the big entity, but might be too late
part:   lure

from then, the player puts the lure on the rebuilt fishing rod and fishes back at the location they discovered earlier, 
and the fish pulls them out to safety.
