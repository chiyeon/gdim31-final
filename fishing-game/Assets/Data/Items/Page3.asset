  note: 'Day 3


    I fear my time here grows too long. Each passing hour it seems
    to get faster, more vicious. I have only barely managed to outrun it.


    The
    last component was hidden amidst the shallow water in the smaller, clustered
    islands. This is the last thing I need to escape.


    I really thought it would
    be on the island with the fallen star. But I scoured that area and nothing became
    of it. '
