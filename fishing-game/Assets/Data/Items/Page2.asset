  note: 'Day 2


    I finally found it, the second component. It was just around
    the waters of the smaller second island off the main one, right across from the
    cluster of smaller spike shaped islands.


    As for life, I seem to have encountered
    another being out here besides the fish. However I want nothing to do with it,
    for it seems to be...searching for something. I fear it may be myself, and that
    I am an unwelcome visitor here. Should it catch me...No, I won''t think about
    it.'
