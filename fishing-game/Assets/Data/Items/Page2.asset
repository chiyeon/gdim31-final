  note: 'Day 2


    Please take note: I''ve found another special component. The
    pieces are starting to fit together. It was just around the waters of the smaller
    triangle shaped island off the main one.


    The entity keeps haunting me.
    It chases when I get close, and I fear for what will happen each time it almost
    catches me. Hopefully there will be another chest awaiting you ahead.'
