  note: 'Day 1


    I am being hunted.


    I''ll continue to lay these chests
    down in the hopes that someone will find them and piece the parts together. It
    may take a few tries to fish it up, but it will come.


    Please take note:
    I found something, and it''s important to getting out of here alive. If I live
    past this note, there will be another chest with the item. And another thing...Although
    this ghostly apparition can move wherever it pleases, it will not see you if
    you hide behind something!'
