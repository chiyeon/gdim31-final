  note: 'Day 1


    Something is hunting on this strange night. I fear what will
    happen if it catches me.


    I''ll continue to lay these chests down in the
    hopes that someone will find them and piece the parts together.


    Please
    take note: My fishing rod snagged onto something essential for escaping this
    place. I found it near the spikey rocks away from the main island. Luckily I
    had my map to navigate. If I live past this note, there will be another chest
    there.'
