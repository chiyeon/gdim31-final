  note: 'Day 1


    There is no sign of life besides the fish, not any that I can
    detect immediately in any case.


    I''ll continue to write these and leave
    them behind in these crates, if by some miracle someone will find them.

    island. I somehow managed to snag onto it with my hook. That was not the only
    thing I brought to the surface however.'
