  note: 'Day 4


    I believe the next step is to use all three of these components
    combined to hook the magnificent beast hidden below the face in the sky. This
    is surely the way out I thought.


    But even as I tried, nothing came of it.
    It merely swims below me, uninterested.


    I will return these items where
    I found them. I''ll hold out for as long as I can, but I fear this is the end
    of my story. If anyone is reading this, farewell, may you find a better fate.'
